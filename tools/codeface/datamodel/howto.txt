1.) How to synchronise entity-relationship-diagram and SQL script

The definitive source for the content of the database is the
entity-relationship model defined in the (unfortunately
binary) file codeface.mwb. Whenever this file is changed,
a new copy of the SQL script in codeface_schema.sql needs
to be created. To do so, please

- Load the schema with mysql workbench, version 6.0 or above
  (smaller versions generate vast amounts of superfluous
  whitespace all around the script)
- Select File->Export->Forward Engineer SQL CREATE script
- Activate the checkboxes
  "Generate DROP statement before each CREATE statement"
  "Generate DROP schema"
  "Generate separate CREATE INDEX statements"
  and none else
- Click "Next", and choose to export table, view and routine objects
  (and nothing else)
- Click "Next", and save the generated script, and create a version
  control system commit with both the binary and SQL creation script
  changes.

2.) How to automatically create the codeface database

* To set up DB codeface

  mysql -ucodeface -pcodeface < codeface_schema.sql
  (replace username and password with the appropriate values)

* To use a different DB name:

  cat codeface_schema.sql | sed -e 's/codeface/codeface2/g;' | \
      mysql -ucodeface -pcodeface
  (replace codeface2 with the desired name)
